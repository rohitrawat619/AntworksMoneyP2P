					<h2 class="lender-maincomnt">My money is working for me. WOW!</h2>
					<p class="lender-comt">I was sceptical about p2p investments as it is fairly new in India. One of friend recommended Antworks p2p for investment and I thought to give a shot. Believe me, I couldnâ€™t be more apt about my decision. I started with a small amount to check their platform and found that it is reliable to generate good return. Just like my friend I also recommend people to go for Antworks p2p.</p>

					<p class="lender-comt">I was searching for some good investment option on web and stumble upon Antworkp2p.com. I visited their website and got a call in evening about the whole thing. Their executive helped me in understanding of P2p investment and got me registered as Investor. I started with INR 50000 and choose to invest on my own. I was surprised by the featured they provide to lender to monitor and review the performance of their portfolio. I realised a fairly good return on my investment with 5 months of time.</p>

					<p class="lender-comt">Antworks p2p is highly reliable and much awaited platform in p2p domain. I started investing on their platform on late 2020 and since them I have been consistently lending to borrowers on their platform. I use the Antworks rating to judge borrowers profile and then lend them money. Their rating helped me in mitigating the default risk on my investment. I highly recommend Antworks p2p platform to earn better returns and thus maximise your earning potential.</p>

                                <p>Banks in India generally lend as per their defined norms which are aimed at Borrowers having a credit history, high credit bureaus score of more than 600, low debt levels and clean payment track record. In addition, Banks as per their internal policy, restrict lending to certain clusters (on the basis of industry, region, profile or social background). This leaves a large section of people who are in need of credit however they are not in a position to get it leaving them exposed to borrowing from unorganized lenders which charge them exorbitantly high interest rates.

                                <p>Unorganized lending is prevalent in India for centuries. This is done by local moneylenders, traders and HNIs. Antworks P2P Financing’s P2P loan services bring all these unorganized players on the marketplace and enables them to lend to credit worthy borrowers in a transparent and fair manner. Also, Antworks P2P Financing’s loan services is appropriate for persons with surplus funds, wanting to deploy on fixed return investment products, intends to diversify investment options and having ability to assess borrower profile. The Antworks P2P market place provides better rates of interest than the traditional model because it removes the intermediaries and connects the lenders directly to the borrowers. Traditionally, banks collect money (through savings accounts or deposits like fixed or recurring) at low interest rates (say 6-9%) and lend it to borrowers at much higher rates. This margin goes into recovering high overheads and cost of salaries. Through the process of disintermediation, we enable lenders to lend at a higher rate of interest, while keeping the borrowing costs competitive.</p>

                                <p>We encourage all Borrowers to make timely payments to avoid penalty charges. In case the due EMI is not paid, a penal interest (by whatever name called) over and above the regular rate of interest of the loan is applied. The penal interest is charged on the overdue amount in case the delay is in payment of one EMI. In case more than one EMI is overdue, the Penal Interest would be calculated on the total outstanding loan amount.</p>
                                <p>In case, a Borrower fails to repay to the Lender any two consecutive instalments (EMI) of the loan amount on the due dates i.e. designated dates on which they are due for payment, Lender will be at liberty to initiate legal proceedings against the Borrower which would include inter alia the following:</p>

                                <p>The Lender can also approach Antworks P2P Financing for initiating legal action on the Borrower on behalf of Lender.

                                <p>The interest rate on the loan is calculated based on the agreed rate of interest between Lender(s) and the Borrower. The EMI for each loan would be different basis the interest rate agreed between Lender and Borrower.</p>
                                <p>Multiple lenders can bid to provide loan to the borrower within interest range indicated by the Borrower. Since the Borrower is looking for minimum rate of interest, he would obviously prefer the lowest bidder and the lender has more chances to win the bid if he bids close to the lowest range indicated by the Borrower. We keep this fully transparent so that Borrowers and Lenders can take decision basis as much information available.</p>
                                <p><strong>Following is stage wise process for deciding rate of interest:</strong></p>
                                <p>Step1: Borrower completes the Personal and Occupational Information and fills up the Loan Request form. A Peer Loan Request No (PLRN) is generated on filing up of Loan Request form. A Borrower can only request for one loan at the same time and a separate PLRN is generated each time. The proposal is immediately visible to thousands of lenders on our site on the Loan listing page.</p>
                                <p>Step 2: After proposal is listed on the site, Borrower has the option to take it to bidding any time of his choice by clicking Start bidding button available on his profile page (biding section). When the Borrower clicks on the start bidding option, the proposal will start appearing in the Active bid listings. In case a Lender is interested in participating in the Bid, he can do so by clicking bid button on the active bids page.</p>
                                <p>Step 3 : When a lender bids, the bid is registered provided conditions A and B below are fulfilled</p>
                                <p>A.	He is an active Registered Lender </p>
                                <p>B.	His bid is meeting the criteria relating to amount. His bid is in the range provided by Borrower, lowest being lower range provided by borrower, then going up by 0.25%</p>
                                <p>C.	C.	Tenor for loan is decided b Borrower and it can’t be changed by lender</p>
                                <p style="display:none;">Step 4- Bid is deactivated on happening of any of two events: A. Bid registered for more than adequate of loan amount and B. Expiry of 336 hours from the time bid starts</p>
                                <p>Step 4: A lender has option to view both the Loan Listing pages and Active bids Page on the site and search listing on basis of different criterion.</p>
                                <p>Step 5: A Borrower has right to accept or reject the bid received from the lenders. The bidding rules are subject to changes from time to time. The rules of bidding are always listed on the portal.</p>
                                <!--p>Step 6 - if bid is deactivated on getting necessary response, bid will be declared successful and if bid is deactivated as it failed to get full support, the bid is declared unsuccessful</p>
                                <p>Step 7: The system will automatically chose the bids which were received at the lowest Rate of Interest as per bidding rules. The bidding rules are subject to changes from time to time. The rules of bidding are listed on the portal.</p>
                                <p>Step 8 :The system automatically selects the winning bidder and the Borrower and the lender is informed through a message on his Antworks P2P Financing's Profile Page and through SMS on the registered phone number. When both parties give the go-ahead, the process of signing the formal loan agreement is initiated.</p-->
